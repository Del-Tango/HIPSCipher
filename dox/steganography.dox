[ Image-Based Steganography ]:

    Steganography is the art and science of concealing information within seemingly
    neutral data in order to keep the existence of the information confidential.
    In the context of digital images, image-based steganography involves hiding
    data within image files without visibly altering the original image. This
    covert communication technique is employed for various purposes, ranging from
    secure data transmission to privacy protection.

    Techniques:

    LSB (Least Significant Bit) Embedding: LSB embedding is one of the most
    common techniques, involving the replacement or manipulation of the least
    significant bits in the pixel values of an image.  It takes advantage of
    the fact that a small change in the least significant bits of pixel values
    is less likely to be noticed by the human eye.

    Frequency Domain Techniques: These techniques involve transforming the
    image into the frequency domain using methods like Discrete Cosine
    Transform (DCT) or Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).  Data is then embedded
    in the transformed coefficients, and the inverse transform is applied to
    obtain the steganographic image.

    Spread Spectrum Technique: This technique spreads the data across the
    image, making it harder to detect.  Each pixel or a group of pixels carries
    a part of the hidden message.

    Phase Coding: In phase coding, the phase information of the image is
    manipulated to embed data.  This method is less common but can be robust
    against certain types of attacks.

[ EXIF Manipulation ]:

    EXIF (Exchangeable image file format) is a standard for storing metadata in
    image files, including details such as camera settings, date and time, and
    geolocation. Manipulating EXIF data in images is another form of steganography,
    often used for information hiding or tampering.

    Key points regarding EXIF manipulation:

    Data Concealment: Hidden data can be stored within EXIF fields without
    visibly altering the image.  Commonly used fields include user comments or
    custom fields that may not be immediately visible when viewing the image.

    Metadata Tampering: EXIF metadata can be altered to mislead or deceive,
    changing information such as date and time, camera model, or GPS
    coordinates. This can be used for privacy protection or to manipulate the
    context of an image.

    Security Considerations:

    Detection Challenges: Steganographic techniques aim to be undetectable,
    making it challenging to identify the presence of hidden information in
    images.

    Authentication Risks: Manipulating EXIF data can raise concerns regarding
    the authenticity of an image, as altered metadata may indicate tampering.

    Robustness and Capacity: The choice of steganographic technique depends on
    factors such as the required data capacity, robustness against image
    processing, and the potential impact on image quality.
